BouncyBall
==========

A javascript physics thing I was playing around with

You can click the mouse to create an explosion that repels the ball.  There are some other effects you can try if you use the number keys instead...

1 key - Explosion
2 key - Vaccuum
3 key - black hole
4 key - sticky spot
